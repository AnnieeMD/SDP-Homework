# SDP-Homework

This is my homework for Data Structures and Programming course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics at Sofia University 'St.Kliment Ohridski'.

The task is to create a hierarchy that describes the relationships within one branch of the association of professional tennis players - the ATP Tour. These relationships are represented by constructing a tree. Program input can be read from either a text file or standard input. 
The program also supports operations such as find, num-subordinates, manager, salary, fire, hire, modernize, etc.
